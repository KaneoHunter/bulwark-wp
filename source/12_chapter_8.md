# The Future

## The Bulwark Tool Chest

A collection of code snippets, APIs, libraries, scripts, and knowledge that will serve to encourage a bazaar-like environment where developers who may be seeking the addition of cryptocurrency support in their projects are free to exchange knowledge, information, and code.  We believe that providing developers with these tools parallels providing a carpenter the tools they need to create exciting and masterful projects.  

## Privacy and Software Enhancements

We are committed to adopting new protocols that will enhance the privacy of our userbase.  There are several paths we are evaluating at present and plan to begin internal testing and development of in the first half of 2018.  Some of these enhancements include:

- I2P privacy network
- Zerocoin protocol or Stealth addressing (Whem we are confident in the maturity of the solution)
- Synchronizing our codebase closer with Bitcoin mainline
- Streamlining/Updating QT Wallet
- Libtox Integration
- Virtualization/containerization of the Bulwark wallet to add an extra layer of security

## Bulwark Secure Home Node

We will be working with CAD specialists to design a small, self-contained, home Bulwark node.  Users will be able to connect this to their home network and configure using a Web UI.  The functions we intend to launch with are as follows:

- For those with stable internet connections, an easy to set up fully onionized masternode (or full node) using TOR hidden services
- Option to function as a relay to improve the overall TOR network
- VPN and/or proxy that can be used to route home internet traffic through TOR/I2P network
- Bulwark staking through either virtualization or an add-on device

In keeping with the spirit of decentralization, the 3D printable files and all source code will be available to the community for home assembly.

## Extension of our Branding

We will continue to extend our brand and intend to work with hardware vendors and system integrators which share the same passion and ideals that we do.  In five years we want the name 'Bulwark' to be synonymous with not just cryptocurrency but privacy, security, and the respect for a user's freedom. Bulwark's main purpose is to provide freedom of choice through privacy.


## Design and Visual 

Through Research and Development, we aim to create a visual design language for Bulwark that sets it apart from its competition in the crypto market. Our design team plans to innovate and experiment with the current UI/UX/Branding to ultimately achieve design excellence by searching for a medium that allows the best user experience, and aesthetics that are innovative and beautiful. This will be done by researching our competitors, keeping on top of current technological trends & standards, and continuously striving to bring new and exciting visuals to the end-users.
