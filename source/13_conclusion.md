## Summary

Bulwark is a privacy-oriented coin with masternodes, governance, and an evolving ecosystem of tools.  The project began with a fair launch and a focus on broad coin distribution.  The slow start, block reward split, and hashing algorithm were deliberately selected to create opportunities for significant community participation.  Bulwark launched with a variety of important privacy coin features and the development team is hard at work to introduce new features and build upon existing technologies.  Bulwark aims to empower choice through privacy and will focus considerable effort to this end.

## Future work

The masternode privacy coin ecosystem has recently been inundated by coins seeking to entice new users through promises of substantial returns on investment, gigantic road maps filled with improbable deliverables, and a general focus on marketing over actual improvement within the space.  Bulwark plans to be the opposite: low on hype creation and high on actual creation.  Present and future goals for the project will follow the formula of being specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound.
