# Introducing Bulwark

## A solid foundation

Every home needs a solid foundation, and Bulwark is no different.  Bulwark is built upon \textit{PIVX}, which itself is built upon the popular \textit{DASH} cryptocurrency.  While lineages can all be traced back to the original Satoshi Core, each project has chosen a particular direction with goals and ideals that represent the communities they serve.  We will extend, and place emphasis on, the privacy coin features of our predecessor platforms by exploring new technologies, while creating tool sets and opportunities for Bulwark's integration into present day technology platforms.

## A team dedicated to the community

For some projects, communities are an afterthought. Bulwark's number one priority is the community.  With giveaways, contests, a lively discussion platform and a zero-tolerance policy toward the harassment of newcomers, Bulwark strives to be the cryptocurrency for all varieties of end-users.  Members of our userbase are already contributing useful scripts and guides to further enhance the user experience.

## Fair and balanced

At the time of writing, there have been an influx of cryptocurrencies utilizing a similar foundation.  While the underlying technology is solid, oftentimes a deeper examination of their specifications and blockchain parameters reveals less-than-fair practices.

## The trouble with pre-mine practices

### Case Study: FooBarBazCoin 

A growing trend in the cryptocurrency space is to choose an arbitrary date far into the future and then base a premine percentage on the circulating supply as of that date.  Let's take a look at the fictional FBC (\textit{FooBarBaz Coin}), a \textit{DASH} fork.

- Block Reward: 15
- Block Time: 2.5 minutes
- POW/Masternode Split: 50/50%
- Initial difficulty algorithm: KGW
- Subsidy decreases by 12% each year
- Maximum Coin supply: ~25 Million
- 2.5% pre-mine

In this example, an advertised 2.5% pre-mine translating to ~643,000 coins (out of ~25 Million) seems reasonable to the casual observer. However, for both PoW and Masternode rewards to match the coins the developers hold, it would take approximately 43,000 blocks.  At a target of 2.5 minutes per block, it would take roughly 150 days for miners (or 75 days overall) to generate the same amount of coins.  After 75 days, the developers would still control half of the coins in existence.

## A fairer alternative

The Bulwark Team recognized this, and decided to be up-front.  Our pre-mine of 489,720 coins (3.5%) represents a little more than 12 days of PoW mining or slightly more than 10 days of overall production.  Hopefully this will serve to instill a peace-of-mind in the community that, after a certain point, the market cannot be significantly devalued as a result of the coins held by the core team.  As you can see in the figures below, both representing 180 days in each scenario, the difference is very clear.  We hope that in approaching the subject in a frank manner will set precedence and serve to benefit the community as a whole.

### Instamines and our approach

Dash (Darkcoin) presents an interesting case study on the need for instamine protection. Nearly 10-15% of the total Dash supply was created within the first few days of the coin's existence thanks to some enterprising users [@Instamine]. Our approach to the instamine issue was two-fold.  We utilized a slow subsidy in which the first 960 blocks (1 day) linearly ramped up to the full block reward with 100% of block rewards going to miners that day as well.  Historically, this has been approached by a very small block reward that suddenly shifts at a certain height to a full block reward, however, this has oftentimes resulted in pools getting deliberately DDoSed or overwhelmed with new miner traffic.  With a linearly increasing reward, there would be no point to attempt to interfere with miners or pool operators for monetary gain.

### ICO?  More like IC-NO!

Let's face it, at the time of writing we're constantly being barraged with \textit{ICO}s.  While they have their legitimate place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, oftentimes they only serve to create concentrated pockets of wealth.  Considering that Bulwark both offers Masternode rewards and, in it's second phase, proof-of-stake rewards, this concentration of wealth can cause huge market swings and tilts the governance system strongly in the favor of the earliest (and wealthiest) adopters.  While concentrations of wealth are unavoidable as a whole, we believe that any opportunity we can take to keep the playing field even is an opportunity worth taking.  We launched with a scaled block reward strategy, a fair launch mechanic to encourage a broad distribution of Bulwark across many users, ideally avoiding some of the wealth concentration seen in other projects.

## Fast and functional

With a 90 second block time, masternode consensus and transaction locking, reasonable emissions schedule, and eco-friendly staking, Bulwark aspires to be a truly fast and functional cryptocurrency.
